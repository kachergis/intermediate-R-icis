# intermediate-R-icis

Intermediate R tutorial for ICIS, May 2021. To get started, open up the file `tutorial.Rmd`.

# Course blurb

This course builds on basic R skills and introduces the tidyverse, a suite of tools for data wrangling and visualization. We’ll cover the most common analytic pathway from a developmental dataset (XLSX or CSV) to a nice graph. Attendees will leave with pointers to some of the exciting tools that become available once you’re familiar with this ecosystem.

# Versions

This is a version of a `tidyverse` tutorial that I have used in many contexts, originally for the `data on the mind` workshop at Berkeley in 2017. The original repository is [https://github.com/mcfrank/tidyverse-tutorial]().
